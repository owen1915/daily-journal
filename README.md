# Project Idea:
We will be creating a web application where users can create daily journals. The site will allow users to look back on past journals and view statistics on how often they have been journaling. We are still contemplating on adding certain features like a friending feature where friends can see each otherâ€™s daily journals. We will use NextJS(React Framework) for both the backend and frontend. We will use Firebase for the database, and we will deploy using Vercel.
